%%
example: "en"

name: js
%%desc:

An array reference of names of JavaScript files you want to include in
your header. To add C<async> or C<defer> to the script tag, use a hash
reference in place of the name of the script with the keys C<src> for
the file and then any true value for C<async> or C<defer> to add
those.

To add JavaScript as text, use a field C<text>.

%%
example: ['cat.js', 'dog.js', {src => 'parrot.js', async => 1}]

name: meta
%%desc:

Meta-tag things which you want to add, for example author, description
or keywords meta-tags. The value must be an array reference containing
hash references.

Note that the C<viewport> meta tag and the C<charset> meta tag are
included by default.

%%
example: [{name => 'author', content => 'Long John Silver'}]

name: link
%%desc:

Link elements. The value must be an array reference containing hash
references. Each hash reference must contain the compulsory C<rel>
key, otherwise it is not included in the output. 

If no C<href> is present, a warning is printed. This warning may be
turned off with L</quiet>.

CSS stylesheets can be added using this, but they can also be added
more simply using the L</css> option.

%%
example: [{rel=>"icon", type=>"image/png", href=>"favicon.png"}]
